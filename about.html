        <p>
            I am <strong>Lewis Eze</strong>, the founder of <strong>GenX WebDevs</strong>, a company I created to empower teenagers by providing them with opportunities to develop and showcase their web development skills. My passion for technology and a strong belief in youth empowerment have driven me to bridge the digital skills gap among teens and foster a new generation of tech-savvy leaders.

            My journey began as a high school student at Parow High School, where I noticed the untapped potential in my peers and the lack of opportunities for them to explore careers in technology. This realization inspired me to start GenX WebDevs, a company that not only creates websites but also serves as a platform for teenagers to gain hands-on experience and build their portfolios.

            In addition to running my company, I've led various initiatives, including organizing a coding competition at my school to ignite a passion for programming among students. I also played a key role in putting together the "Leadership Empowerment Day," which showcases my commitment to youth development.
        </p>
        <p>
            My innovative approach to education and technology has gained attention and support from my community and local businesses. I am currently focused on expanding GenX WebDevs to reach more students and offer comprehensive training in web development, coding, and digital entrepreneurship.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a forward-thinking leader, I am not only focused on building my company but also on creating a lasting impact on the next generation. I am determined to continue advocating for youth empowerment through technology, ensuring that young people are equipped with the skills they need to thrive in the digital age.
